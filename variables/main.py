# Rule Of defining a variable in pyton 
# Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z or an undrscore(_)).
#THey can contan letters, numbers, and undrscores.
# Variable name are case-sensitive (age and Age are different).
# Avoid using python keywords (ilf, for ,while ) as varible names.
# 34age = 4 #invalid because variable cannot start with a number
# age 32 # avlid because variable can start with a number
#  a$$age = 45 # invalid because varibales cannot contain special characters other than underscore _.
__age = 34   # valid
